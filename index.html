                        <p> My goal at this stage is to get new skills necessary for a junior developer
                            and develop them to a high level. Another goal is also to successfully complete
                            the rs school course and enroll the Epam. This is very important for me as it 
                            will be a whole new level in my life. I don't have any professional experience 
                            in this field yet, but I feel that I want to do it, and if a person lights up 
                            with something, they won't stop until they achieve the result.</p>

                        <p>I studied at ITMO University. Listened to lectures of Epam, took online courses

                        <p>English has existed since primary school, but in the last few classes, it was very weak.
                        At university English was 3 years, during the period of study my level was about B2, at 
                        the moment this level fluctuates between <b>A2-B1</b>(elementary-intermediate).

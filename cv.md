3. My goal at this stage is to get new skills necessary for a junior developer and develop them to a high level. Another goal is also to successfully complete the rs school course and enroll the Epam. This is very important for me as it will be a whole new level in my life. I don't have any professional experience in this field yet, but I feel that I want to do it, and if a person lights up with something, they won't stop until they achieve the result.

4. **Skills** (in my memory): development experience in C, C++, C#, a little java and python, html, css, git basics

5. (Later)

6. The experience of C# paint development, Java chat, application with C# + SQL database. Unfortunately, was young and stupid and did not save training projects :(

7. I studied at ITMO University. Listened to lectures of Epam, took online courses on html, css on [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com), [html academy](https://htmlacademy.ru).

8. English has existed since primary school, but in the last few classes, it was very weak. At university English was 3 years, during the period of study my level was about b2, at the moment this level fluctuates between **a2-b1**.
